    "  - Example:\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "   # Get the columns: Sample_ID, Sex, Height and Rings\n",
    "   subset = abalone[['Sample_ID', 'Sex', 'Height', 'Rings']]\n",

    "- *Boolean Indexing*\n",
    "  - Purpose: to filter rows that match desired criteria\n",
    "  - Introduced:  Pandas Part 1 Notebook\n",
    "  - Example:  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "   # Finds all rows with sex of \"Male\" and the number of rings > 3.\n",
    "   matches = (abalone['Sex'] == 'Male') & (abalone['Rings'] > 3)\n",

    "   male = abalone[(abalone['Sex'] == 'Male') & (abalone['Rings'] > 3)]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grouping Data**:\n",
    "- *`groupby` function*\n",
    "  - Purpose:  To group rows together by \"classes\" or values of data. Allows you to perform aggregate functions, such as calculating means, summations, sizes, etc. You can create new data frames with aggregated values.\n",
    "  - Introduced:  Pandas Part 2 Notebook. \n",

    "  - Purpose: To combine two dataframes.  Depending if the columns and row indexes are the same determines how the data frames are combined.\n",
    "  - Introduced:  Pandas Part 2 Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Melting**:\n",
    "- *`melt` function*\n",
    "  - Purpose:  Handles the case where categorical observations are stored in the header labels (i.e. violates Tidy rules).  It moves the header names into a new column and matches the corresponding values.\n",
    "  - Introduced:  Tidy Part 1 Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pivoting**:\n",
    "- *`pivot` and `pivot_table` functions*\n",
    "  - Purpose: The opposite of `melt`. Uses unique values from one more columns to create new columns.\n",
