abstract = {Eight flavone C-glycosides isolated from rice plant were found to act as probing stimulants for planthoppers. They have been identified as the known compounds schaftoside, neoschaftoside, carlinoside, isoorientin 2″-glucoside and the new constituents neocarlinoside (6-C-β-D-glucopyranosyl-8-C-β-L-arabinopyranosylluteolin), isoscoparin 2″-glucoside (chrysoeriol 6-C-β-D-(2-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl)glucopyranoside) and its 6‴-p-coumaric and ferulic acid esters.}
