    "A **list** in Python is a **data type** that allows you to store a collection of values together in a single variable. Lists are sometimes referred to as **arrays**. We've already used lists!  Remember the `argv` variable we use when providing arguments to a program? The `argv` variable is imported from the `sys` module. Remember this:\n",

    "The `argv` variable is actually a list.  We are importing a list into our program when we use the `from sys import argv` statement.  Another time we encountered lists was when we used the string `split()` function to split a comma-separated or tab-delimited file into a list of values. The `split()` function returns a list.   Now, we will explore lists in more details. "

    "```python\n",
    "my_list = []\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the code above, the variable named `my_list` is **defined** and is initialized as an empty list using the square brackets `[]`.\n",
    "\n",

    "languages = ['Afrikaans', 'Italiano', 'Slovenčina', 'اردو', '中文']\n",

Likewise, the number `1` would references the second element, and so forth.  In most prgramming languages, lists (or arrays) are **zero-indexed** meaning they start indexing from zero.  In contrast, the R languages is one-indexed. If you use R, make sure you remember the difference. The following table shows the index for each element of the `languages` variable:\n",

To do this, you were required to call the `readline()` function on the file object 10 times.  This resulted in some very repetitive code. Also, we were limited by the number of calls to `readline()` that we programmed. The `data/iris_data.csv` file has 150 lines.  Calling `readline()` 150 times to import the data is not practical. Looping to the rescue!  Here we will learn to perform tasks repetitively in a succint way using loop statements."

At each toop the number is incremented by 10. When the value is equal to 100 the condition is no longer true and the looping stops. Similar to `if` statements, the conditional statement can be as simple or as complex as needed."
