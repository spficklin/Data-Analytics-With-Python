    "A **list** in Python is a **data type** that allows you to store a collection of values together in a single variable. Lists are sometimes referred to as **arrays**. We've already used lists!  Remember the `argv` variable we use when providing arguments to a program? The `argv` variable is imported from the `sys` module. Remember this:\n",

Another time we encountered lists was when we used the string `split()` function to split a comma-separated or tab-delimited file into a list of values. The `split()` function returns a list.   Now, we will explore lists in more details. "

    "```python\n",
    "my_list = []\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the code above, the variable named `my_list` is **defined** and is initialized as an empty list using the square brackets `[]`.\n",
    "\n",

Likewise, the number `1` would references the second element, and so forth.  In most prgramming languages, lists (or arrays) are **zero-indexed** meaning they start indexing from zero.  In contrast, the R languages is one-indexed. If you use R, make sure you remember the difference. The following table shows the index for each element of the `languages` variable:\n",

In some practice exercises you were asked to read in the first 10 lines of the file and perform some mathematical operations. To do this, you were required to call the `readline()` function on the file object 10 times.  This resulted in some very repetitive code. Also, we were limited by the number of calls to `readline()` that we programmed. The `data/iris_data.csv` file has 150 lines.  Calling `readline()` 150 times to import the data is not practical. Looping to the rescue!  Here we will learn to perform tasks repetitively in a succint way using loop statements."
