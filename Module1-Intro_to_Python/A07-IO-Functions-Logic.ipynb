One of the most important tasks in data analytics is the ability to read data files into your Python scripts and to write files with results or reformatted data.  The process of reading and writing files is also referred to as File Input/Output or File IO.  Next, functions are a critical component of all modern programming languages. They provide several benefits.  They help you to simplify your programs and encapsulate commonly used code into reusable bits of code.

    "Python provides a built-in function named `open()` that allows you to open a file either for reading or writing. We will learn to use it to do both.  There are two types of files that Python can open: plain **text** files and **binary** files.  A text file contains human-readable text.  It may have some special encodings, which we will learn about, but in general you can open it with any text editor and read it.  A binary file is one where the contents are machine-readable. The language of the computer is 1's and 0's (binary). These files store information in patterns of 1's and 0's that are not legible by a human. If you open one with a text editor you will often see a series of illegible characters. Text and binary files can store the same information but binary files can be organized to access data more quickly and store data more compactly.  In data analytics, many data files are plain text files, often in tab-delimited, or comma-separated formats.  In this lesson, we will learn to read and write text files only. Binary files are more complicated and if you see a binary file that needs reading there is often a Python library with functions that you can use to read the file for you."

    "Notice, in the instruction above, the second argument to the `open` function is the string `\"w\"`. This tells Python to open the file for writing.   The `\"w\"`, or \"write\", mode will also create the file if it does not exist.  This is convenient because we do not have to precreate the file.  But, what if the file already exsits? If we use the `\"w\"` mode and the file exists then the file will be opend for writing but all existing contents will be removed. The file will become empty and the file handle will be set at the beginning of the file, ready for us to add new content.  If the file exists and we do not want to erase the contents we can use the `\"a\"` mode (for \"append\").  The `\"a\"` mode will open the file for writing, it will not empty the file contents, and it will set the file handle at the end of the file. Once the file is opened and ready for writing, then there are two ways we can write to a file: using the `write()` method of the file object or, using the `print()` function."

The language of computers is 1's and 0's and these 1's and 0's can be combined to form numbers.  Thus, the ASCII encoding used numbers to represent characters in the English language. For example, the character \"A\" was encoding using the number 65. A \"B\" was encoded using the number 66, etc. A lowercase \"a\" was encoding using the number 97, \"b\" as 98 and so forth.  The ASCII encoding is still used today, but it cannot be used for languages other than English, it can only represent 128 characters and those 128 numbers are already accounted for. \n",

    "Before we learn to write our own functions, lets take another look at function arguments. If you look at the built-in function reference for the [open() function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open), you will see a formal definition of the function that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "open(file, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None)\n",

    "Notice there are several arguments that you can provide to the `open()` function. We already used **file**, **mode** and **encoding** in the previous sections. We will not learn about those other arguments here, but you can read the online documentation to learn more. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing we can immediately see from this definition, though, is that some of the arguments look like variables with assigned values (e.g. `bufferng=-1`). When an argument has an assignment in the function definition it means that variable gets a default value if the variable is not provided.   Notice that the `mode` argument is set to the string `'r'` which sets the mode for \"reading\". That's why the `open()` function always supports reading by default. You have to specify `mode='w'` to open a file for writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "One other item to point out.  If you specify the variable names when you call the function then they can appear in any order. Otherwise, arguments must appear in the order that the function defintion describes. The following are all valid calls to the `open()` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Open a file for reading.\n",
    "data_file1 = open('my_data1.csv', encoding='UTF-8')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a second file for writing.\n",
    "data_file2 = open('my_data2.csv', encoding='UTF-8', mode='w')\n",

    "# Open a third file for appending.\n",
    "data_file2 = open(encoding='UTF-8', mode='a', file='my_data3.csv')\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the first two open calls, the file variable is not named, so it must appear first because its first in the function definition.  Named variables afterwards can appear in any order. In the first call, notice there is no mode argument so it gets a default value of `'r'`."

    "You will notice that the first two lines of code above are the logic statements we looked at above. This time, though, the value of the comparison is stored in the variables `comp1` and `comp2`.  Those will be boolean values (i.e., `True` or `False`).  The third line of the code uses the **and** comparision. If both `comp1` and `comp2` are `True` then it will return `True` and set the variable `result` to that value.  But, the `comp2` comparision is not `True`, so the **and** comparision will return `False`. Lets observe this by running the following cell: "
