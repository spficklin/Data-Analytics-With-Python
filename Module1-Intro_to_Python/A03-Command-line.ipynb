    "Often, we interact with desktop computers, such as a Windows or Mac computer, using a graphical desktop interface. We browse files using a point-and-click interface and interact with programs by clicking menus, links and buttons. However, prior to the modern graphical interface, people  interacted with computers using a text-based command-line.  You may have heard of MS-DOS or the UNIX shell. These both provide command-line, text-based interpreters that allow the user to interact with the underlying operating system. You can navigate through the file system using text-based commands and run programs and tools by typing their names and parameters.  \n",

    "\n",
    "In early versions of Windows the shell was called MS-DOS. Now, the command-prompt and powershell are used. UNIX systems often come with multiple different shells and the user can choose which to use. One of the most popular is the [BASH shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)). The Apple OS X operating system is also UNIX-based and uses as its default the [Z shell (Zsh)](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/).  All of these shells tend to provide the same fundamental commands, which we will learn here. But, they become different the more advanced you get.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter terminal, which we will use for this course uses the default shell of the operating system you are using. So, on a Mac, you'll get Zsh, on Ubuntu you'll get BASH and on windows you'll get the Powershell.\n"

    "## Keyboard Shortcuts\n",
    "Typing all of these commands can get a bit tedious, especially for long paths. Fortunately the shell often provides some shortcuts that you can use to make typing faster:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <kbd>&#8593;</kbd> Type the up-arrow key when at the command-prompt to cycle up through your most recently entered commands. This is helpful if a command did not work because you made a mistake. You can easily type the up-arrow key, which will cause your last command to reappear exactly as you entered it. You can then correct the mistake and re-run the command. There is no need to re-type the entire thing. \n",
    "* <kbd>&#8595;</kbd> As with the up arrow key, the down arrow lets you browse back down through your command history.  \n",
    "* <kbd>TAB</kbd> When typing a path to a file it can be tedious especially if the file name or path is long. You can often shortcut your typing by typing the tab key after typing the first few letters of the file. For example, if you type `~/cour` + <kbd>TAB</kbd>, the shell will automatically fill in the rest for you.  It cannot fill in the rest if there are multiple files that begin with the same set of letters, so type a few more characters until you can uniquely identify the file.\n",
    "* <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd> Terminates the current command.  If you are running a command that seems to be stuck this will usually get you out of it and return you to the command-prompt.\n",

    "## Debugging the Command-Line\n",
    "If you encounter errors when working with the command-line it can be baffeling at times what might be wrong, or why the command you typed did not behave as expected.  Often the shell will provide you with some error message and when you are new to the command-line it can be a bit mysterious what those error messages mean.  It is only through practice and more practice that you begin to recognize common mistakes but initially you may spend too much time trying to figure out what went wrong!  That can be extremely frustrating, especially since you have so many demands on your time.  Therefore, follow these steps to help reduce the amount of time you spend trying to fix things that go wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **READ**: When you first presented with an error message pause and read the entire message. Resist the urge to skip over it because it looks foreign.\n",
    "2.  **STOP**: Understand the error message!\n",
    "    - Always remember that error messages tell you exactly what is wrong even if you do not understand what its telling you.  \n",
    "    - Take some time to make sure you understand it.\n",
    "    - Never assume you know what the solution to a problem is unless you understand the error message, because, if you do not understand the error message but think you know what is wrong and apply a fix odds are you may make a mistake and now you have two problems... the original problem and the incorrect fix.  That can quickly become difficult to resolve. \n",
    "    - If you do not understand the message try the following:\n",
    "      - Try to find official documentation for the error message to help you understand it? \n",
    "      - Explore online forums to see if someone else has had the problem. But be careful, these forums can sometimes mislead you.  \n",
    "      - Ask for help from someone you trust!  A co-worker, a fellow student, or the course instructor.  \n",
    "    - If you do understand the error message:\n",
    "      - Test it.  Just like with the scientific method, try performing a test to see if you can repeat the error and confirm that what you think is wrong really is wrong.  \n",
    "3. **NEVER**: skip an error or apply a \"band-aid\" fix to get around it.  If you do not stop to try to understand what went wrong you are setting yourself up for problems later and you will waste time. It's better to spend the time up front to learn than to learn through the school of hard-knocks when something again goes wrong.\n",
    "4. **FIX**: now that you know what's wrong and why its wrong you can fix it. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "    <b>Important</b>: The more you follow the steps above the better you will get with the command-line and also with Python programming, and the less time, overall you will spend trying to fix problems.\n",
