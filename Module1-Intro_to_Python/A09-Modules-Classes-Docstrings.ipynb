    "\n",
    "A **module** is a file that contains Python code. It can contain variables and functions.   Anytime you create a Python file you can use the functions and variables you define in other Python files.  Remember we have learned about the [sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html) module and we use the `argv` variable it provides.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `argv` variable is a list and we import it, already populated with command-line arguments, from the `sys` module.   Just like the `sys` module, Python provides a variety of modules that you can use. These are documented as part of the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/). Examples include [Numeric and Mathematical Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/library/numeric.html) and [File and Directory Access Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/library/filesys.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone can create a new Python module. And modules that you create can be shared and used within other Python files you create or shared with others to use.  Lets try an example. Create a new file named `my_module.py` and cut-and-paste the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(x, y):\n",
    "    return (x + y)\n",
    "\n",
    "def subtract(x, y):\n",
    "    return (x - y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, create a  new module named `my_test.py` and cut-and-paste the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from my_module import add\n",
    "from my_module import subtract\n",
    "\n",
    "result = subtract(add(2, 3), 2)\n",
    "print(\"The answer is {}\".format(result))\n",
    "```\n",

    "You should see the following output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "The answer is 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, we created a module file named `my_module` that defines a set of functions. We created two functions: `add` and `subtract`. You can easily imagine that we could provide any number of useful functions in a module.  Our program, `my_test` is able to use the `add` and `subtract` functions because we imported them with these statments:  \n",

    "import my_module as mm\n",

    "### 1.2. Classes.\n",
    "#### 1.2.1 Class Creation\n",
    "Modules can have more than just functions and variables, they can also have **classes**. Here we will learn some basics to help you recognize them. You can think of a class in simliar terms as a module. A class contains variables and functions. But unlike a module, which is just a python file, a Class allows the programmer to provide some data protections that a module does not.  A class is created by using the `class` keyword.  For example, lets create a class named `MyNumber` that will allow us to perform math on any integer number that is provided. It will protect our number from anyone doing anything inappropriate to it.  We start our class in this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyNumber:\n",
    "   \n",
    "    # Functions go here\n",
    "    \n",
    "```    \n",
    "A class is simply a blueprint for an object.  Remember that strings, integers, lists, etc., are all objects in Python.  We have used functions such as `strip()`, `split()` and `upper()` that are provided by the string object.  It is the class that defines what these functions are.  When we create an object it is an **instance** of a class.  The following code creates an instance of a string object that contains the text \"Pullman\":\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "city = \"Pullman\"\n",

    "### 1.2.2 Class Constructors\n",
    "Classes have functions. You are free to create any function you need and name them as you wish. We will see this later. The exception, however, is a function called the **constructor**.  The constructor function is called automatically whenever the class is **instantiated**. Instantiation means the class is used to create an actual object.  The constructor must be named `__init__`.  Inside the constructor you perform any steps needed to setup your object.  One important task is creation of attributes.  Let's see an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyNumber:\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def __init__(self, x):\n",
    "        self.x = x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code above we have created a constructor function named `__init__`.  It has two arguments: `self` and `x`.  The `self` variable is always required for all functions in a class. Python always passes the object in as the first argument of any class function, so you must include it.  The following arguments can be anything needed for the class. In our case, we simply need a single variable that will have the number.  "

    "### 1.2.3. Class Attributes\n",
    "Classes can have functions and variables.  We want our class to maintain variables that we want to protect from the user. These are called class **attributes** or **member variables**. The idea is that a user of the class can only act on the attributes via its functions. This way we can protect the variable from unwated changes.  We should define our attributes in the constructor function.  In the code of section 1.2.1 you will see that we have created an attribute. We see the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def __init__(self, x):\n",
    "    self.x = x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The attributes belong to the class object so we reference them using the `self` variable. Notice in the constructor the use of `self.x`?  Notice, we assign to `self.x` the value of the argument `x` and the variable `x` is passed into the constructor.  In this code, there are two variables with the name `x`: one in the object (referenced as `self.x`) and the one passed in to the function.  The variable `self.x` is a class attribute. We transfer the value of the variable `x` and store it in the member variable of our object, `self.x`.  We can have any number of attributes that we choose."

So far, our class simply accepts a value in its constructor and stores it in the attribute `self.x`.  Lets add a function to print that value:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The new `print()` function in the class uses the `self` argument.  Remember that all class functions use `self` as the first argument.  We do not need any other argument for the `print()` function because the number value is already stored as an attribute in the object as `self.x`. So, we can simply call print and use the `self.x` variable when printing. This will cause the current value of the attribute, `self.x`, to be printed."

During instantiation of the object, the new object created by Python is passed into the constructor as the `self` argument and the value of `xval` is passed into the constructor as the `x` variable. The constructor then sets the internal `self.x` attribute by copying the value from the `x` variable. If we want to test that the consturctor worked and the member variable `self.x` got set we can call the `print()` function that belongs to the class:\n",

    "We took a brief look at classes for two reasons. First, understanding classes will help you understand how objects work.  Think about the string object.  Now you know, there is a class definition for it in the Python standard library. The `strip()` and `split()` functions simply act on an attribute that stores the text.  Python is repleat with modules that provide classes and it is important to know what is going on behind-the-scences when you call functions that act on attributes that classes store. Second, it gives us another opportunity to look at functions and variables and consider the concepts of variable scope."

    "1. Add a main() function and the `if` statement shown in Section 2.3 that checks if it is being used on the command-line.\n",
    "2. Add docstring documentation to the top of the file.\n",
    "3. Add docstring documentation to the `main()` function.\n",
    "4. Add the global variables that that instructions indicate you are allowed to use. These are named `AREAS` and `COLUMNS`. Put them near the top of the program and be sure to add a comment explaing what they are and that they are global\n",
    "5. The input file for your project is named `covtype.data`. But, you should not \"hard-code\" the name of the file inside of your program. Instead you should pass in the name of the file on the command-line using an argument. Add a line of code to the `main()` function of program that allows it to receive the name of the input file on the command-line.\n",
