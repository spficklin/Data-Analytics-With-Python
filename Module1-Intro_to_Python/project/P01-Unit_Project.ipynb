    "\n",
    "1. Learn to navigate tools that support computer programming for Python.\n",
    "2. Program linear scripts in python.\n",
    "3. Program scripts that include functions, logic, and control statements\n",
    "4. Manage data within the program using lists and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You will meet these objectives by applying everything you have learned throughout the course in the implementation of a script for data analysis."

    "## Background\n",
    "One of the most important uses for the Python programming in science is for **Data Analytics**.  With data sets becoming increasingly large (**volume**), complex (**variety**) and arriving faster (**velocity**)--the 3 V's of **big data**--scientsts are in greater need of programming skills.  Excel is insufficient and why wait around for an informatician when there are tasks you can do on your own! \n",
    "\n",
    "While a lot of open-source, freely-available software programs and websites are also written in Python, this module is geared for training you in the basics of Python towards use in Data Analytics. Therefore, for this project, we will write a Python script that can use those basic skills to read in a data file and perform some basic statistical analysis."

    "\n",
    "> Natural resource managers responsible for developing ecosystem management strategies require basic descriptive information including inventory data for forested lands to support their decision-making processes.  However, managers generally do not have this type of data for inholdings or neighboring lands that are outside their immediate jurisdiction.  **One method of obtaining this information is through the use of predictive models.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "> [The purpose of this dataset is for] predicting forest cover type from cartographic variables... The actual forest cover type for a given observation (30 x 30 meter cell) was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System (RIS) data... Data is in raw form (not scaled) and contains binary (0 or 1) columns of data for qualitative independent variables (wilderness areas and soil types). \n",
